My name is Billy Houseman. I am a data analyst from the United Kingdom with an interest in machine learning and data engineering. I was employed as a data analyst at the Welsh Government (United Kingdom) where I developed reports and visualisations to be used in national policy development. I am passionate about data and applying data science techniques to solve real world problems. I have experience with creating and maintaining databases, developing data pipelines using AWS cloud services and programming in R and Python.
