summary:  Following on from my first project, I decided to create an interactive dashboard using RShiny, summarising the data and the results. I believe allowing users to interact with the data themselves allows them to develop their own conclusions whilst reinforcing the findings of the project. Additionally, it improves the users engagement with the project and thus increases the likelihood that they will actively think about the conclusions and the methods as they explore the data. Within this dashboard the user can explore my own findings, additionally, the user is allowed to create their own clusters and observe how the data is separated.
