summary: League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena game developed by Riot Games where two teams fight one another to obtain a victory. Within the game there are over 150 playable characters, each grouped into 1 of 7 classes (Classes are groups of characters with similar playstyles). The overall goal of this project was to use data about each character alongside K-Means clustering to correctly classify them into their corresponding classes. In doing so the current classification system can be validated and areas of improvement identified. The results are presented in the form of tables and visualisations. This projected was completed using R.
